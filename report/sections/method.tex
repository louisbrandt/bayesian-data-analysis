\section{Methodology}

Try some different models for the problem 
For each model, motivate it, describe the archetecture and the fitting and evaluation procedure.

\subsection{Simple Temperature \& Week-day Model}
From a high level, keeping with bayesian principles: prior/ expert knowledge
motivated a simple linear regression with temperature and day of the week as
predictors. Backup up by EDA, clear weekly pattern and positive temperature
correlation over the all time period.

\subsubsection{Model architecture}

-- Priors 
  - unassuming normal distributions
--Likelihood
  - Normal likelihood with unknown variance and mean given by the linear model
  variance models certainty on a given day
  - Student T:
  We might want to consider a Student T likelihood as it is more robust to outliers
  and has a heavier tail than the normal distribution. This is useful as we have
  a lot of data and we want to be able to capture the occasional outlier.

Fitting
-- MCMC
  - NUTS
Good convergence, short training

Prior predictive check
  Normal distribution - standard good tings -10 to 10
  Student T - -inf to inf, not ideal 
  Data might not be so spread out after all
