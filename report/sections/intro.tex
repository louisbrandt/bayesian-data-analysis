\section{Introduction}

% What is Bayesian Data Analysis?
Alternative reasoning of model parameter approximation of a statistical model.

Asking a more intuitive question than frequentist methods.
Frequentist: Given the underlying trend, what are the chances of observing the data?
Bayesian: Fixing on the observed data and deciding how to update our beliefs about the model parameters.

-- Define the problem
Common problem setting: Predicting total revenue on a daily basis The modelling
real world phenomena is infitiely complex: The revenue generated is a compound
of indiviudal human decisions Decisions need to be made about what we care
about enough to model, as well as how to control for factors outside the model
that may affect the outcome. Great setting for the evaluating the assumptions
and results of a model.
How to choose variables of interest?
Expert opinion, domain knowledge, time series analysis?

-- Approaches
Time series
Machine learning
Bayesian - what does it offer?
  Handling of Uncertainty: 
  Handling of Data: Bayesian methods can be beneficial
  when dealing with limited, noisy, or incomplete data, as they allow for the
  incorporation of prior knowledge to help inform model parameters. 
  Model Comparison and Selection:

-- Bayesian Data Analysis
What is the priority? 
Accuracy of prediction, understanding the underlying process, modelling uncertainty

What is the data? 

What is the optimal data to fit the model?

What is the ideal model 

How do we know what the ideal model is ?

What is the potential?
Accurate forecasting means better decision making, and more efficient use of resources.
