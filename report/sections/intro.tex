\section{Introduction}

% ------------------- Introduce Bayes --------------------------

Accurate revenue forecasting plays a pivotal role in the success of businesses,
aiding in efficient resource allocation, planning, and well-informed
decision-making. In this study, we delve into the application of Bayesian
models for predicting daily revenue at Copenhagen based poke bowl chain called
OLIOLI. By comparing the performance of various Bayesian models and evaluating
their usefulness, we aim to provide insights into the advantages and
limitations of these methods in a real-world context, and contribute to the
ongoing research in the field of Bayesian data analysis.
% Intuitive questions: Fixing observed data and updating beliefs about model parameters
Grounded in the principles of Bayes' theorem, Bayesian modeling provides an
alternative to the classic frequentist approach in data analysis and modeling.
Bayesian methods incorporate prior knowledge and facilitate a more intuitive
understanding of uncertainty, which can be particularly useful for tackling
complex real-world challenges.
% Handling uncertainty 
In practice, the prior belief is represented by a probability distribution over
the model parameters, which is updated to a posterior distribution after
observing data. This posterior distribution is then used to make predictions
and inferences about the model parameters. By their nature, probability
distributions are well suited to represent uncertainty 
% Model comparison and selection
% Additionally, the Bayesian method provides a principled framework for the comparison 
% and selection of different models. The best model for a problem is assumed to be 
% the most simple model able to explain the observed data and bayesian comparison methods 
% discussed in this paper provide a way to quantify this simplicity.

% ------------------- Define the problem --------------------------
% Daily revenue prediction
One area where modelling uncertainty is helpful is in revenue prediction and forecasting. 
This paper focuses on a case study to illustrate the application of Bayesian methods
and how the various decisions at steps of processing, modelling and comparison propegate 
to the final model and its predictions.
% Real-world phenomena complexity
When modelling real-world phenomena, the complexity of the problem can make it difficult 
to find a useful model - accurate and interpretable - and is therefore an exciting domain 
to test and evaluate theoretical methods.
% Revenue as a compound of individual human decisions
The revenue of a store is a compound of an immeasurable number individual human
decisions, which makes choosing the relavent, measurable variables of interest
a challenge. 
% Deciding on variables of interest: Expert opinion, domain knowledge, time series analysis
Here, we are guided by experts and their domain knowledge, who
have long been aware of the various temporal factors that influence revenue -
and what daily, weekly, and seasonal patterns mean for the business. The
weather thought to be another source of variablility throughout OLIOLI and it
was this that motivated the study of various weather phenomena on revenue.

% ------------------ Research Questions ----------------------------

In light of these approaches, the research questions that will be addressed in this paper are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the best performing Bayesian model for predicting daily revenue for OLIOLI with weather data?
    \item What is the optimal data volume for optimal revenue prediction?
    \item What are the assumptions and compromises of different models, and how do they impact the performance and the interpretability of the results?
\end{enumerate}

% ---------- Testing, evaluation, Bayesian comparison ------------

% Using real-world sales data for the case study
% Selection of the optimal model and data for specific problems
% Context-dependent decision-making
To answer these questions, we will test, compare and evaluate multiple Bayesian
models and evaluation metrics, using real-world sales data from OLIOLI. Current
research in the field exists for motivating the deployment of Bayesian models,
with methodologies existing for their evaluation and comparison. Despite this,
the exact process for selecting the optimal model and data for a specific
problem remains unclear and context-dependent.

This paper consists of five further sections. First, background theory is
introduced aimed to provide a foundation of knowledge from which the Bayesian
analysis of the case study can be understood. Second, the case study is
introduced and the data is investigated. Third, the methodology motivates and
describes the models, as well as reflecting on the initial predictive
performance of the various approaches applied to the case study. Fourth, the
results are fully presented, discussed and the Bayesian models are compared.
Finally, the paper is concluded with a summary of the findings and a discussion
of the limitations and future work of the study.

% Thorough testing, evaluation, and comparison of different assumptions in Bayesian data analysis
% Focus on revenue prediction for a restaurant chain
% Potential for accurate forecasting, better decision-making, and efficient resource allocation
The contributions of this paper are manifold, providing a comprehensive
testing, evaluation, and comparison of the different assumptions within the
realm of Bayesian data analysis; through the vessel of the mentioned case
study. By investigating the research questions and evaluating the performance
of various Bayesian models, this study aims to not only demonstrate the
potential for accurate forecasting but also emphasise the potential benefit of
informed decision-making and efficient resource allocation in a business
context.
