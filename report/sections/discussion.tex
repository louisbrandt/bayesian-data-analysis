\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Summary}



\subsection{Limitations}

% Instead of Interpolation for missing values, add features which flag days of interest to get valuable predictions for all days

% Daily revenue given previous day is difficult - a live model would have access to data by the hour

% Not using Hierarchical models may have given us a ceiling 


\subsection{Future Work}

% Hierarchical Models for a more nuanced, usable and interpretable insight into revenue 

% Include Bowl price as parameter to model revenue 

% Projection - 'what if' scenarios
